# Bot_with_speech_recognition

This repository contains two bots: a Telegram bot and a VK bot, developed using Python. Each of them is designed to interact with users through the respective messengers.

## Telegram Bot

The Telegram bot has the following functionality:

- Responds to user text messages.
- Utilizes DialogFlow for message processing and providing responses.
- Can be configured for various commands and dialogue scenarios.

### Example Dialogue with the Telegram Bot:

## VK Bot

The VK bot provides similar functionality but for the VKontakte social network. It also uses DialogFlow for message processing and responding.

## DialogFlow

DialogFlow is a platform for creating chatbots, which has extensive capabilities for natural language processing and creating conversational interfaces. We use DialogFlow to train our bots and provide them with intelligent capabilities.
